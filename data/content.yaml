Profile: I am a 23-year old Spanish computer scientist specialized in natural language processing. During my studies I have especialized on projects that involved semi or fully-unsupervised automatic translation and/or that utilize word embeddings in some capacity. I currently work as a data scientist and engineer, designing natural language processing solutions and integrating them into data pipelines along human annotation and evaluation workflows.

Experience:
  - Employer: Datamaran Limited
    Place: Valencia, Spain
    Positions:
      - Title: Data Engineer
        Date: Sept 2019 - Present
