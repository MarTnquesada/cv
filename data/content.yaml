Profile: (what I want to say - I am specialized in machine learning and more specifically in nlp. Aside from that, I do work mostly involving data engineering and some web backend) I am a 24-year old Spanish computer scientist specialized in natural language processing. During my studies I have especialized on projects that involved semi or fully-unsupervised automatic translation and/or that utilize word embeddings in some capacity. I currently work as a data scientist and engineer, designing natural language processing solutions and integrating them into data pipelines along human annotation and evaluation workflows.
